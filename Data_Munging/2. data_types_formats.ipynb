Structured data exists\nwhen information is clearly broken out into !elds that have an\nexplicit meaning and are highly categorical, ordinal or numeric.\nA related category, semi-structured, is sometimes used to describe\nstructured data that does not conform to the formal structure of\ndata models associated with relational databases or other forms\nof data tables, but nonetheless contains tags or other markers.\nUnstructured data, such as natural language text, has less clearly\ndelineated meaning. Still images, video and audio often fall under\nthe category of unstructured data. Data in this form requires\npreprocessing to identify and extract relevant ‘features.’ #e features\nare structured information that are used for indexing and retrieval,\nor training classi!cation, or clustering models.\nData may also be classi!ed by the rate at which it is generated,\ncollected or processed. #e distinction is drawn between streaming\ndata that arrives constantly like a torrent of water from a !re\nhose, and batch data, which arrives in buckets. While there is\nrarely a connection between data type and data rate, data rate has\nsigni!cant in&uence over the execution model chosen for analytic\nimplementation and may also inform a decision of analytic class or\nlearning model.\n\n### Structured data types\n\nThe four basic types of data are:\n\n##### Nominal data: \ncategorical data with no inherent ordering between the categories. For example, a “pet type” variable could consist of the classes {dog, cat, rabbit}, and there is no relative ordering between these two types, they are just different discrete values.\n\n#####  Ordinal data: \ncategorical data with an inherent ordering, but where the “differences” between categories has no strictly numerical meaning. The canonical example here are survey responses with responses such as: {strong disagree, slightly disagree, neutral, slightly agree, strongly agree}. The important character here is that although there is a clear ordering between these types, there is no sense in which the difference between slightly agree and strongly agree is the “same” as the difference between neutral and slightly agree.\n\n#####  Interval data: \nnumeric data, that is, data that can be mapped to a “number line”; the important aspect in contrast with ordinal data, though, is not the “discrete versus continuous differentiation (integer values can be considered interval data, for instance), but the fact that relative differences in interval data have meaning. A classical example is temperature (in Fahrenheit or Celsius, a point which we will emphasize more shortly): here the differences between temperatures have a meaning: 10 and 15 degrees are separated by the same amount as 15 and 20 (this property is so inherent to numerical data that it almost seems strange to emphasize it). On the other hand, interval data encompasses instances where the zero point has “no real meaning”; what this means in practice is that the ratio between two data points has no meaning. Twenty degrees Farenheit is not “twice as hot” in any meaningful sense than 10 degrees; and certainly not infinitely hotter than zero degrees.\n\n#####  Ratio data: \nalso numeric data, but where the ratio between measurements does have some meaning. The classical example here is temperature Kelvin. Obviously just like temperature Fahrenheit or Celsius, this is describing the basic phenomenon of temperature, but unlike the previous cases, zero Kelvin has a meaning in terms of molecular energy in a substance (i.e., that there is none). This means that ratios have a real meaning: a substance at 20 degrees Kelvin has twice as much kinetic energy at the molecular level as that substance as 10 degrees Kelvin.\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-05aa2faf-38bf-4594-9f7c-b842da76716c","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Common data formats and handling\n\n1.
