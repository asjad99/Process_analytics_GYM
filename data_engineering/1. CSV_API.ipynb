Fortunately, a fair number of web-based data services you will use in practice employ something called REST (Representational State Transfer, but no one uses this term) APIs. We won’t go into detail about REST APIs, but there are a few main feature that are important for our purposes:\n\n1. You call REST APIs using standard HTTP commands: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT. \n2. You will probably see GET and POST used most frequently.\n3. REST servers don’t store state. This means that each time you issue a request, you need to include all relevant information like your account key, etc.\n4. REST calls will usually return information in a nice format, typically JSON (more on this later). The requests library will automatically parse it to return a Python dictionary with the relevant data.\n5. Let’s see how to issue a REST request using the same method as before. We’ll here query my GitHub account to get information. More info about GitHub’s REST API is available at their Developer Site.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-c06d0fcb-b920-42a0-b700-47a35c6ae026","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00007-603a4f07-002f-4734-aef0-29903f63a33c","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"#### Get your own at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\ntoken = \"3125e4430a58c5259a14ddd48157061cdb7055c0\" \nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.github.com/user\", params={\"access_token\":token})\n\nprint(response.status_code)\nprint(response.headers[\"Content-Type\"])\nprint(response.json().keys())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00008-d626788e-cce1-4d50-a032-af69b8b2bf04","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Common data formats and handling\n\n1.
