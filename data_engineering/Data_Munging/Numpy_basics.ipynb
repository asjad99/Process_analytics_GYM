It combines the best of the previous two libraries Numeric package(created in mid-90s) and Numarray. It has now become widely popular for manipulating, cleaning and munging data. Numpy is also highly popular in scientific community and has recently been used to perform computations needed to discover black holes and gravitational waves.  It provides a multidimensional Python array object (a data structure that efficiently stores and accesses tensors) along with array-aware functions that operate on it. \n","\n","I wrote a blog post associated with it: https://asjadkhan.ghost.io/ghost/#/editor/post/5f62b4b8672f7e00394a960f\n","\n","A lot of code has been inspired from following resources: \n","\n","- https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/\n","- https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/\n","- Python-for-Data-Analysis-2nd-Edition\n","- Array programming with NumPy"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Creating an array from python list\n","\n","We can create a numpy array using a number for methods.
